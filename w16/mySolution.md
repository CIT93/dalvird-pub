Challenge:
If you run your dishwasher or washing machine more than 9 times per week, then add 3 points. If you run it 4 to 9 times, then add 2 points. If you run it 1 to 3 times, then add 1 point. If you don't have a dishwasher, then add nothing.
If you have a dishwasher and a washing machine, then perform the calculation twice.

For the first part I would add two options:
Question: Select appliance you have at home:
* Dishwasher
* Washing Machine
Then based on the the user's answer I would calculate the output of the questions below twice or once:
Question: How long you run the dishwasher / washing machine at home:
- Dishwasher / Washing Machine runs more than 9 times per week (3 points)
- Dishwasher /Washing Machine runs 4 to 9 times per week (2 points)
- D / W runs 1 to 3 times per week (1 point)

I can also do it so that the first question is asked after the selection drop down.
