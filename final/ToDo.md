## 3 things I want to add to my app:
* First I want to implement all the code I planned to when designing the app. 
    - Adding other inputs: task type, task deadline, task time estimate, task completed and or task priority
* Show the house room numbers and type in the rendered table. 
    - Here I want to make this output editable, meaning the user can change it right away in the text box, so 
    I can do the time calculation correct. 
* I would like to add a button where a user can get a random task (like a wheel) and it gives them one
    - All the tasks would go there and it would pick one to give to the user
    
* Finally I would like to do some styling to make it more attractive and fun, most people don't like doing chores
